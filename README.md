# Kubernetes Architecture Diagram

This repository contains a visual diagram of a microservices architecture deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It represents a system composed of a game server, a blog, and multiple databases, all distributed across three nodes within the cluster.

## üìå Contents

- **game-server**: Node dedicated to running the main game server, Redis for caching, and telemetry services.
- **blog**: Node that handles the frontend and backend of the blog, with NGINX and API services.
- **databases**: Node containing PostgreSQL, MySQL, and an authentication service.

The diagram also illustrates the flow of external user requests, exposed services, and components such as the `kubectl` client.
